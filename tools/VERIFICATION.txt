VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.

Sadly the Author does not provide Checksums for his Releases so the only way is to download the Setup yourself and and compare the Checksum in the Install Script.
I made an Issue on the Projects Github to get official Checksums for each Release https://github.com/jendrikseipp/rednotebook/issues/381
